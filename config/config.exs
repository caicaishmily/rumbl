# By default, the umbrella project as well as each child
# application will require this configuration file, as
# configuration and dependencies are shared in an umbrella
# project. While one could configure all applications here,
# we prefer to keep the configuration of each individual
# child application in their own app, but all other
# dependencies, regardless if they belong to one or multiple
# apps, should be configured in the umbrella to avoid confusion.
